                     <h1>About Me</h1>
                     <strong><small>I am a 33 year old native of Chicago that has spent the last few years working and living in Afghanistan.</strong>
                       
                        <p>As an innovative and results-driven Project Manager, I have managed projects on empowering 
                            Afghan women and helping the people attain work throughout the whole country. We have 
                            monitored projects through completion through proper use of SDLC and donor relations. 
                            Unfortunately, all work and projects came to an end when the Taliban took control and we were 
                            evacuated due to security concerns. The last couple of months have been compiled with keeping 
                            up with the disaster of a situation and getting out individuals who are at high risk. I would like to 
                            use my experience and education to continue helping out with Refugees in America or where 
                            ever need be. 
                            My ability to speak Dari and Pashto and to understand the needs of the Refugees can be of use 
                            with your organizations goals. My Project Management background encompasses a focus in 
                            technology management, cyber technology, cloud security, and big data. My experience has 
                            allowed me to learn and grow to be successful in team building and project management from 
                            conception to completion. I excel in team motivation and management, and utilizing all available 
                            resources to achieve superior outcomes. During my career I have continually anticipated
                            potential challenges and issues in order to proactively prepare for and resolve them. I am highly 
                            collaborative and believe that to be the foundation needed in any project in order to ensure total 
                            success.
